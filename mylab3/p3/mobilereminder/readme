This version of the mobile reminder program will attempt to maintain a reliable connection through UDP.
The client will register with the server.
The server will acknowledge the registration.
If a new client connects, the server will drop the old client.
The client will request that a missed packet be retransmitted, by tracking which reminders it has received
	and which it has not.

To compile:
	Without Debugging:
